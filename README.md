# **Business OS: The Ultimate AI-Powered CRM + CMS + Marketing Automation Suite**

## **🚀 The Product**
**Business OS** is an all-in-one, AI-powered **CRM, CMS, Marketing Automation, Social Engagement, Omnichannel Communication, Payments, and Invoicing solution**—designed to eliminate the need for fragmented business tools.

## **❌ The Problem: High Costs & Complexity**
Businesses waste **capital and time** integrating multiple, expensive SaaS tools:  

| **Feature** | **Existing Solutions** | **Cost** |
|------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **CRM** | Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho | $50-$100/month per user |
| **CMS** | Webflow, WordPress, Ghost | $10-$50/month |
| **Marketing Automation** | Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign | $20-$100/month |
| **Payments & Invoicing** | Stripe, Paddle, QuickBooks | 2-5% per transaction |
| **AI-powered Assistants** | ChatGPT Enterprise, AI tools | $20-$50/month |

Businesses **shouldn’t have to juggle multiple tools** just to manage customers, content, marketing, and revenue.

## **✅ The Solution: One System. One Price. One Integration.**

Open the generated `graph.svg` file with any SVG viewer.

![graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28964599/233662744-3ba89713-8466-49cd-9be7-e6fb38191f58.png)

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

- **Unit and integration tests**: 
  ```bash
  pnpm run test
  ```
- **End-to-end tests**:
  - Headless:
    ```bash
    pnpm run e2e:headless
    ```
  - UI:
    ```bash
    pnpm run e2e:ui
    ```

### Acceptance & Smoke Tests
Use Storybook’s [play function](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function#writing-stories-with-the-play-function) for acceptance testing & run smoke tests with:
    
  ```bash
  pnpm run test-storybook
  ```

[Example Storybook play function:](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function#working-with-the-canvas)
```ts
export const FilledForm: Story = {
  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {
    const canvas = within(canvasElement)
    const emailInput = canvas.getByLabelText("email", { selector: "input" })
    await userEvent.type(emailInput, "example-email@email.com", { delay: 100 })
    const submitButton = canvas.getByRole("button")
    await userEvent.click(submitButton)
  },
}
```

## 🎨 Styling & Design System

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and CVA (Class Variance Authority) for creating variants in a type-safe manner.

### CVA – A New Approach to Variants

CVA simplifies creating reusable, consistent component variants without the overhead of complex CSS-in-JS solutions. Check out [CVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Zv73yZ_QI&ab_channel=Vercel) for more details.

## 💾 State Management

We use [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management, offering a lightweight, fast, and scalable solution. You can also consider alternatives like Jotai or Recoil depending on your needs.

Example usage:
```ts
// store.ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

type Store = {
  count: number
  inc: () => void
}

const useStore = create<Store>()((set) => ({
  count: 1,
  inc: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}))

function Counter() {
  const { count, inc } = useStore()
  return (
    <div>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={inc}>one up</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 💻 Environment Variables handling

We use [T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) for validating and transforming environment variables at build time.

Example configuration `env.ts`:
```ts
import { z } from 'zod'
import { createEnv } from 't3-env' // or your chosen env library

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    SECRET_KEY: z.string(),
    EMAIL_API_KEY: z.string(),
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  client: {
    API_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  runtimeEnv: {
    SECRET_KEY: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
    EMAIL_API_KEY: process.env.EMAIL_API_KEY,
    DATABASE_URL: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  },
})
```

If the required environment variables are not set, you'll get an error message:

```sh
  ❌ Invalid environment variables: { SECRET_KEY: [ 'Required' ] }
```

## Specifics

**Waitlist Form & API**: A simple form component collects emails and posts them to an API route `/api/waitlist` that stores entries using `Prisma`.

**Email Integration**: When a user signs up, a welcome email is sent using [Resend](https://resend.com).

**Document Processing with Rossum**: A dedicated Rossum folder contains configuration (e.g., settings.json) for processing document data such as invoices and receipts.

**Emails & Reports**:
    Using `Resend` combined with React Email for transactional emails. Visualizations are created with `Tremor` charts.
